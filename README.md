# Mobile-Machine-Learning-Model-for-CVD-prediction
* A Neural Network Model is trained on 70K data points to predict the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD).
* The model is deployed in an android application which also provides User Interface to users.
* The model delopyed is on-device model, using Tensorflow's Lite Model, to achieve least latency.
